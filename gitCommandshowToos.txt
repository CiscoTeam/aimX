git repo commands and how tools

• when you enter the working directory of the repo /aimX checkout into the /dev branch
	$git checkout /dev

Once in the /dev branch create your branch. Branch names are your initials followed by your current task.
$git checkout -b bd/signin

Once you are in your branch simply 

*** Please do not push to origin master!!!

* Branch handling:
• to see the branches that are created run:
$	git branch -vva

• to see recent information:
$	git log

• to create a new branch:
	$git checkout /dev
	$git checkout -b initials/currentTask

• Prior to merge rebase your branch with the current sprint branch. This is only necessary for the graphing purposes. 

• to update or "take in changes from the "/dev" branch run:
	$git checkout yourBranch
	$git rebase /dev
this will update your working branch with the changes that anyone else has pushed to the "/dev" branch.

* This is also to be run before a merge to save the graphing format.
• When doing a merge use this syntax:
	$git checkout /dev
	$git merge --no-ff branceToBeMerged

• to show log history:
	$git log branch name
